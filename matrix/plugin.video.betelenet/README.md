# plugin.video.betelenet

## Please note: The Telenet addon currently does not support playback because of 2 persisting issues:
- Login requires inputting a QR code at Telenet which is not supported using the Kodi interface. The only way around this at this time is to retrieve a OESP token from the telenet tv website and inputting this manually in your addon profile directory 
- A static Device ID is required to playback content at Telenet, which changes with each playback using inputstream adaptive on all platforms except Android (meaning at this time the addon can work on Android when manually adding the OESP token to your profile directory
